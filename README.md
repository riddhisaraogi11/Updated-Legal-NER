# Automated Legal Entity Extractor (LexiScan Auto)

## Overview

LexiScan Auto is an **AI-powered legal document analysis system** that extracts structured entities from legal contracts.
The system processes PDF contracts and automatically identifies key legal information such as **dates, parties, jurisdictions, monetary values, and signatories**.

This project combines **OCR, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and rule-based post-processing** to convert unstructured legal documents into structured JSON data.

---

## Features

* Extract entities from legal contracts
* Handles scanned or image-based PDFs using OCR
* Custom **spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER) model**
* Rule-based layer to improve precision
* REST API using **FastAPI**
* End-to-end automated pipeline
* Unit tests using **pytest**

---

## Extracted Entities

The system extracts the following entities:

* **DATE** – contract dates and deadlines
* **PARTY** – organizations involved in the contract
* **PERSON** – signatories or individuals
* **JURISDICTION** – locations and governing law
* **MONEY** – contract values and payments
